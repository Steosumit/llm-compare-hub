# llm-compare-hub
## Overview
llm-compare-hub is a personal problem inspiration tool I decided to build to study the behavior of prompts on LLM.
It hunched me while studying the course: Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT by Vunderbilt University on coursera. 
The tool has the initial draft built with lovable for quicy UI development, followed by manual edits, and
a mostly hand written FastAPI server that was the other inspiration for building this application

## As of now
Development is in progress...
